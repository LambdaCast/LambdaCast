LambdaCast
==========

LambdaCast is your personal **podcast platform** based on Django. It serves your files via projekktor 
and audio.js, serves original files using Bittorrent and gives you feeds for MP4, MP3, and OGG files. 

You can use any podcast fetcher to get the feeds. It is already used by [TheRadio.cc](http://theradio.cc)
